# Ethernaut

[The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players. 

In this repo you can find my solutions to the challenges:

### 01. **Fallback**
This level is about the use and implementation of the fallback function. You need to claim ownership of the contract and reduce its balance to zero.

### 02. **Fal1Out**
In this challenge you have to discover a very tiny mistake (or a typo) and show its terrible consequences. 

### 03. **Coin Flip **
To complete this level you'll need to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row. The goal of this level is to show how tricky random number generation is in Blockchain networks.
