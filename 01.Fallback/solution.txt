Instructions
In this challenge you need to take ownership of the Fallback contract and withdraw the contract's balance.

Attack

The hack is perpetrated in two steps you don't even need to code a smart contract:

1. Use Remix to retrieve the contract. You can use the instance's address.
2. First, call the function contribute and send less than 0.001 ether.
2. Now that you are registered as a contributor (i.e., contribution greater than zero), then send some ether to the contract.
3. Now you are the owner and call the withdraw function.
